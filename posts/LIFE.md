belief -> confidence -> planning -> execution (MCB / "just do it" / doing more in consciousness) -> understand better -> improve

I believe, I will be able to **figure out a way** to provide great experiences to complex problems, methodically and creatively.

Purpose: **figure out a way**
Goal:    **to make complex things easy for others**
By:      
         - Providing great experiences
         - Helping them understand better or explaining it better (Teaching?)
         - Actually diving deeper into complex problems and understanding them first
         - Simplifying the complex things to consumable chunks

Because:
  - It's hard for myself to understand complex problems
  - I really want to understand a diverse set of things
  - I really want to be a smart, successful person

Rules / Guiding Principles

  0. Re-iterate Goals
  1. Remove All Distractions
  2. Discipline / Hard Work (Sir Alex Ferguson's Book) - Pomodoro
  3. Get in the "Just Do It" zone
  4. Review

  A few more
  5. Always against time
  6. In consciousness
  7. Listening

**Some things can't be questioned - thus, rules**

  - Always do one thing at a time
  - Don't argue when driving. Ignore other riders on road, no matter how bad
  - Don't poke situations. Let it go ASAP
  - 

Be curious and be curious in the right way (plan + execute)

If you have clarity, you can communicate better

---

Education & skills are nothing but a lens to look at the problem. The problems remain the same for everyone. It's how I use my lens to solve them.

I have multiple lenses

- UX Design (I look at everything as a design problem)
- Software Engineering (I look at all solutions to be an app)
- Analyst (I will solve it by looking at data)

- MBA (Everything is a business problem - will do all of the above)

# Quotes

- You cannot connect the dots looking forward, you can only connect the dots looking backward. So you have to believe in something, god, karma, whatever that the dots will connect in the future and that is what will help you follow your heart, even when it leads you off from a well worn path, and that is what will make all the difference (Steve Jobs)

- The only way to do great work is to love what you do, if you haven't found it yet, keep looking. (Steve Jobs)

- In a tornado, even a turkey can fly (Guy Kawasaki)

# Sodium Chloride

My mind
It needs to go somewhere
away from the present

I don't feel like being
in the 'right now'

I have rarely felt
like this 

Kind of puke-ish
without eating bad food
Reminds of some old time

The problem is it is attached
What if it were detached?

The bond loosens
It stays independent
looking for another bond

That's what the chemistry
teacher told us
when a Sodium molecule (NA)
reacts with a Chlorium molecule (CL)
to form salt

Salt - an essence to almost every food
Something so basic, so raw only comes from
strong bonds
