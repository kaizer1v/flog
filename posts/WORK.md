Processing vs p5.js - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsjPJ5AWkDc - part 2 of 3

- Processing is a Java library & p5 is a javascript library
- for writing in processing, use the desktop version editor. Obv for p5js is javascript, so you can write it directly on the browser
- you can combine multiple JS libraries when using p5js
- both have `setup` -> `draw`
- processing applications are desktop based, p5.js are browser based
- processing (since it's native / desktop based) is faster. p5js depends on browser speed. This will affect when you want to do 3D stuff, openGL stuff so processing is faster. But there's this thing called WebGL to process 3d on browser based on openGL or three.js
- check p3d and p2d for 3d and 2d rendering
- processing has `loadTable()` to viz from excel data where as `loadJSON` on p5.js. But p5js is a better choice to work with APIs
- Hardware access is unrestricted when using processing. p5js has restrictions - have to use nodejs libraries to access H/W. With processing, can do native stuff on arduino / raspberry
- p5js allows for mobile apps as well (cordova will take web based app and convert into native app)
- file access is easier on processing vs p5js (save, load whatever)
- sound + camera + mic = equally easier on both p5js and processing

When?
- for browser / web based just use p5 (canvas based)
- for desktop based (no point in using it for web based)
- for creative installation - use processing

Also check openFrameworks (C++ based)
