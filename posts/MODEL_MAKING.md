# Part 1 - Assembly 


## General Assembly Notes

* Enamel Liquid Poly = liquid glue. see [ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PSOigHYtCk)


# Part 2 - Brush Painting


## 1. Main Paint

* Use Enamel / Oil paint


## 2. No-paint dry brush

* do this immediately after painting first coat
* to smooth the surface + get shading effect


## 3. Let paint dry completely

* oil / enamel paints will take slightly long time to dry 100%


## 4. <Optional> Varnish 



## 5. Decals

* soak / dip decals in water for 1-2 minutes
* stick decals on model
* brush off extra water after positioning


## Apply Clear <NOT SURE>

to seal off the base colour so that when wiping off wash (next step) - the base colour doesn't come off


## 6. Washing

Washing increases contrast and brings depth

acrylic paint washing
* Use Acrylic paint (Black) or dark colour
* Mix water (majority)
* Put it on cracks, borders, cuts
* Rub off extra with paper napkin

oil paint washing
* see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwtmHh1V8IY)
* before you do this - make sure you use "clear" on the surface (so that your base colour, doesn't come off when removing the extra oil wash - see next point)
* mix thinner + black to make it liquidy
* apply everywhere on the surface
* let it dry for 20 - 25 mins
* wipe off wash from surface with paper towel
* resulting in wash areas only in the panel lines / rivets


pastel colour washing
* pastel colour powder + water + washing powder = mix thoroughly
* apply to surface
* leave it to dry completely
* wipe off excess with paper towel (in direction of air flow)


using wash oil (separate product) 
* see [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=350UBtVXU9Q&t=390s)
* will require enamel thinner (to remove excess)
* take thin (pointed) brush and apply to bolts / panel lines
* let it dry for a bit
* use thinner to remove excess wash


dabbing is also a washing technique
* use enamel / oil colour + thinner
* put spots of similar shade of colours to base colour
* wash off with a thinner


## 7. Weathering / Chipping

For shading
* use enamel / oil paint
* use dry brush to get shading effect

* to get metal / rust feeling
* use shining grey / silver for metal finish
* use brown / mud colour for rust finish
* use sponge (uneven surface) and dab / can use 0 or < 0 brush
* use lighter tone of base colour

## General Painting Notes

* Enamel paint / Oil paint
  - oil based
  - takes longer time to dry
  - glossy finish

* Acrylic paint
  - water based
  - shorter time to dry
  - matte finish


* Thinners
  - why? reduces viscosity of paint. only for Oil paint
  - can be used to "remove" some paint from the model (but only on oil / enamel paint)


* Varnish
  - why? to keep oil / acrylic paint from dust
  - makes final appearance even / smooth
  - for finishing touches
  - can also be done with gloss liquid


* Weathering
  - something that is exposed to atmosphere for too long


* Speckling
  - is a technique for chipping
  - you speckle the brush with your finger to spray droplets on model
